# Welcome to Unruly!

The objective of this game is to color each tile in a way such that:
  1) No three consecutive squares, horizontally or vertically, are the same color
  2) Each row and column contains the same number of black and white squares.
  
  Click on a box to cycle through the colors (White, Black, Grey).
  Click on the undo button to undo your previous move (works in succession).
  (Note: Black and white boxes with a blue border are unchangeable!)
  Hints work based off a single solution, so you may need to change your solution
  to adapt to a given hint!
  
  
  This project was inspired by the Unruly puzzle that can be found here https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/unruly.html
